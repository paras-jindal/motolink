/**
 * Decodes the panel / steering-wheel key frames a BYD head unit broadcasts, and maps them onto the
 * key codes the rest of this app speaks.
 * Information onf how steering wheel keys are handled decoded by reverse engineering BYD system apps
 *
 * On these units the media buttons are **not Android `KeyEvent`s** — not merely unhandled ones, but
 * events that never exist in that form at all. The button reaches the MCU, the MCU reaches
 * `com.byd.multimediaservice` over a serial link, and that userspace service broadcasts a raw byte
 * frame. Nothing writes to `/dev/input/event*`, so `InputReader` never runs and there is no
 * `KeyEvent` for [com.motolink.android.connection.carkey.CarKeyBroadcastReceiver] to pick out
 * of a `MEDIA_BUTTON` intent — the stock player's own `MEDIA_BUTTON` registration on this firmware
 * points at a class that is not in its APK, because there is nothing on the other end of that path.
 * Measured directly: three confirmed key presses inside a window where an activity's
 * `dispatchKeyEvent` was logging every event produced zero dispatches.
 *
 * So the only way to see these buttons is to decode the frame, which is what this object does.
 *
 * Frame layout, from the stock player's `DZ60.dealData`:
 * ```
 *   byte 0 : group id
 *   byte 1 : sub id
 *   byte 2+: payload, meaning depends on group/sub
 * ```
 * Panel keys are group [GROUP_PANEL_KEY] / sub [SUB_KEY_DOWN] with the code in byte 2. The group/sub
 * table describes the *multimedia* channel only; the sibling channels in the same firmware reuse the
 * two-byte header with unrelated meanings (the Bluetooth one puts ASCII device names behind `02 03`),
 * which is why [ACTION] is the single action worth registering for and every other channel is left
 * alone.
