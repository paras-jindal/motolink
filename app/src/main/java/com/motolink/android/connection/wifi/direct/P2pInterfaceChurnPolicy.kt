/**
 * Whether this unit's WiFi Direct is being switched off and on by something other than this app.
 *
 * A driver reloads the P2P interface to create a group, so a burst of DISABLED/ENABLED on its own
 * says nothing about who caused it. Only edges arriving while no request of ours is outstanding
 * count here, which is the one measurement that separates the two. A stack somebody else is cycling
 * refuses every `createGroup` with BUSY, so naming it is the difference between an unreadable log
 * and an answer.
 *
 * It follows that this stays quiet whenever our own retry cadence leaves no gap to measure in, and
 * on three of the five captures behind it that is exactly what happened. Silence here is "not
 * shown", never "not happening": accusing another app on a log that cannot tell the two apart is
 * the one error worth designing against, because the remedy it names is the user disabling
 * something.
