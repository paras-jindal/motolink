/**
 * Asks a head unit's external Bluetooth module whether it will carry Android Auto for us, and
 * watches to see whether it does.
 *
 * Two earlier rounds got us here. The first (2026-08-11) proved the frame layout, the recovered
 * schema and `enable_type = 2` against the real daemon. The second (2026-08-12) asked whether the
 * `HicarServiceRegister` family would take the Android Auto UUID; it would not, and reading the
 * vendor library afterwards showed why — that family is keyed to HiCar's own `FE35`/`FE36` service
 * UUIDs, and the Android Auto bytes were never going to be there. **Message `0x105` is the byte
 * channel**, in both directions, and it needs no registration: the daemon owns the Android Auto
 * RFCOMM server on the module and `RequestInit` with `enable_type = 2` is the whole setup.
 *
 * So this round drives [ZbtByteChannel] — the same class the transport will use — and answers the
 * one question left, which is *operational* rather than protocol: **will the daemon give those bytes
 * to us?** Three outcomes, and they need different next steps, so the run is built to tell them
 * apart:
 *
 * - RFCOMM data arrives → the route works, and the transport is worth building.
 * - The phone links for projection but no data arrives → the daemon serves one owner, and the
 *   question becomes whether being the only client changes that.
 * - Neither → the phone never started Android Auto, which is a trigger problem and not a protocol
 *   one.
 *
 * Round two could not distinguish the last two, because it had nothing to watch that reported a
 * projection link. `PhoneLinkState` is that signal, and this round watches for it.
 *
 * Still almost inert. It opens a loopback socket and reads. The one thing it can do to the module is
 * [askModuleToReconnect], which the caller has to ask for separately.
 *
 * Blocking, and for up to about two minutes. Call it off the main thread and pass [keepGoing].
