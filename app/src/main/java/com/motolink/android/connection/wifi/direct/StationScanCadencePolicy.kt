/**
 * Turns the times this unit's WiFi scanned into one line a reporter can attach to an issue.
 *
 * A scan takes a single radio off the group's channel for tens to hundreds of milliseconds per
 * channel, and nothing in the framework suppresses one for a projection session. That is the
 * standing theory behind the periodic outages, and it has never been testable: `LogExporter` scopes
 * logcat to this app's own process, so no `WifiScanner` or `WifiConnectivityManager` line can ever
 * reach a reporter log at any level. A broadcast we receive ourselves is the only way the evidence
 * gets into one.
 *
 * A summary rather than a line per scan, so a unit whose scans are the problem cannot flood the log
 * it is meant to be diagnosed from. Pure, so the arithmetic is a unit test.
