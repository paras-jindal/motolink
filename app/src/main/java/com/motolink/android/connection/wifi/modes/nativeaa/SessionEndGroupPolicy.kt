 * What the end of a session does to the Native AA network and the Bluetooth side.

 * A session that ends unexpectedly used to stop the launcher and rebuild it, which removed the
 * P2P group and created a new one. On a unit that gives every group a new address the phone's
 * saved network then never matched, and even where it did the phone waited on the create. The
 * network is kept up instead: the phone finds the network it saved, and only the Bluetooth
 * listeners a completed handoff closed have to come back. A user exit still stops everything,
 * because removing the network is the only thing that makes the phone leave it.
