 * offered only for our own access point, whose name and address survive the record, and only while
 * a server is actually listening on the port the record will name. [WppEndpointPolicy] lets a WiFi
 * Direct group through once its identity has been seen to repeat; the QR does not follow it there,
 * because it is asked for from the settings screen, before any group is up to be measured.

 * The refusals are separate values because each one names a different thing for the user to do.
