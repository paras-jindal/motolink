/**
 * The wire framing of the vendor Bluetooth daemon's protocol, as spoken over a loopback socket to
 * the process that owns a head unit's external Bluetooth module.
 *
 * Every message is a sixteen byte header followed by a protobuf body:
 *
 * ```
 *   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16 ...
 * +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------+
 * |    magic      |    version    |    msg id     |   body len    | protobuf  |
 * |  uint32 BE    |  uint32 BE    |  uint32 BE    |  uint32 BE    |   body    |
 * +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------+
 * ```
 *
 * All four fields are big-endian. [MAGIC] is the only one the peer validates; it reads the version
 * into a local and never checks it, so a wrong version is accepted today and may not be tomorrow.
 * A body length below zero is rejected, and a length of zero is legal — the peer writes the header
 * alone for a message with no body.
 *
 * The header and the body arrive as **separate writes**, so neither is guaranteed to land in one
 * read. Callers must accumulate to a byte count rather than trusting a single read to deliver a
 * whole header, which is why this object only encodes and decodes: the reading loop belongs to
 * whoever owns the socket.
 *
 * Pure and tested because it is the one part of the exchange that fails silently. A header we build
 * wrong is not rejected with an error; the peer either drops the frame or, worse, misreads the
 * length and desynchronises for the rest of the session.
