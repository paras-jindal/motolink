 * Whether the wireless stack should stand back and let an in-flight USB session win the start.

 * `onCreate` arms WiFi Direct, the 5288 server and, on Native mode, a Bluetooth HFP poke before it
 * has looked at the USB bus, so a dongle already plugged in gets a whole wireless bring-up raised
 * and torn down around it. [UsbSessionQuiescePolicy] fixes that at connect time, which is too late.
 *
 * The question is deliberately narrow. "Is a USB device attached" would be the obvious one and is
 * wrong: `UsbDeviceIdentityPolicy` accepts an unnamed vendor-class interface rather than guessing,
 * so a peripheral that is permanently plugged in - a dock, an audio or Bluetooth adapter - could
 * hold wireless off on every start. An accessory-mode device or a live switch claim cannot be
 * anything but a projection attempt.
