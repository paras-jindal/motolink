/**
 * A byte pipe to the phone, through the head unit's external Bluetooth module.
 *
 * On `bttype:extra` units the module is a separate chip that Android never exposes, so
 * `BluetoothSocket` cannot reach it — the phone opens an Android Auto RFCOMM channel to the module
 * and our own radio transmits nothing. What can reach it is the vendor daemon `gocsdk_zj`, which
 * owns the module's UART and listens on `127.0.0.1:3152`. This class speaks its protocol and turns
 * the one part we need into an [InputStream] and an [OutputStream].
 *
 * **Message `0x105` is the byte channel, in both directions, and its body is the raw RFCOMM payload
 * with no protobuf around it.** In the vendor library `libzbt_rfcomm_data_send` builds a `0x105`
 * frame straight from the caller's pointer and length, and the receive dispatcher hands a `0x105`
 * body straight to the callback that `libzbt_rfcomm_data_recv_CB_init` registers; `gocsdk_zj`
 * resolves both of those symbols, so the daemon both writes and reads this id. The daemon owns the
 * Android Auto RFCOMM server on the module itself, which is why nothing has to be registered first:
 * `RequestInit` with `enable_type = 2` is the entire setup.
 *
 * Everything else on the socket is control traffic — link state, the module's identity — and goes to
 * [onControlFrame] rather than into the byte stream.
 *
 * **One reader, many writers.** The demultiplexer has no thread of its own and is driven by whoever
 * consumes it: [input] reads frames until it has bytes to return, dispatching control frames on the
 * way, and [pumpOnce] does the same thing on a deadline for a caller that wants to watch rather than
 * read. Those are two doors into the same loop, so exactly one thread may be behind them at a time.
 * Writing is different: the handshake sends from its own thread while a wake or a poll may go out
 * from another, so every frame write takes [writeLock] and reaches the socket whole. A frame
 * interleaved with another frame's bytes would desynchronise the daemon permanently.
 *
 * [bufferRfcommData] picks how received bytes are delivered, and a caller must take one or the
 * other. A transport reads them through [input], so they are buffered; a caller that only watches
 * takes them from [onRfcommData] and must not buffer, or the backlog grows to [MAX_PENDING_BYTES]
 * and kills a channel that was working perfectly.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped as streams because that is the seam the handshake already has:
 * `NativeAaHandshakeManager.sendProtobuf`/`readProtobuf` take a bare `OutputStream`/`DataInputStream`,
 * `WppFraming` never sees a socket, and `WppHandshakeSession` has no imports at all. A ZBT backend
 * therefore needs none of that changed — if any of it has to change, the seam is in the wrong place.
