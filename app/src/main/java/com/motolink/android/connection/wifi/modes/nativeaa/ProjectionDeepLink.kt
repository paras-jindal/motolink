/**
 * Builds Android Auto's own wireless-setup deep link, the URL behind the QR code a real head unit
 * shows during pairing.
 *
 * This is how a head unit whose Bluetooth the phone cannot reach gets provisioned. There is no
 * RFCOMM channel to carry a WifiVersionRequest, so the TCP endpoint has to arrive another way, and
 * the phone accepts this one from any app because its resolver is exported. Scanning it once writes
 * the network and the endpoint into the phone's known-car record; every later connection then
 * starts on its own when the named Bluetooth device connects.
 *
 * The Bluetooth address is an identity, not a route. The phone requires the device it names to be
 * connected, but never checks that it is this head unit, so a unit with no usable adapter of its
 * own can name one the phone is already connected to.
 *
 * Pure, and tested: a field the phone rejects costs the user a scan that silently does nothing.
