 * A user-visible step of bringing a connection up, shown on the home screen status pill.
 *
 * Deliberately coarser than the AppLog milestones it is reported from: retries inside one step
 * collapse onto one stage so the pill does not stutter while that machinery works.
 *
 * [rank] is the display order, declared rather than taken from ordinal so a stage can be inserted
 * without renumbering the rest. Stages from different paths may share a rank; only one launcher is
 * ever active, so they never race.
