/**
 * One phone-side connection the wireless handshake can run over.
 *
 * The handshake needs surprisingly little from its transport: two streams, a way to close them, and
 * enough identity to write a useful log line. Everything that makes the exchange what it is —
 * `WppFraming`, `WppHandshakeSession`, the reader coroutine, the stage deadlines — is already
 * written against `InputStream`/`OutputStream` and never mentions Bluetooth. Naming that surface
 * here is what lets a second transport exist without any of it changing.
 *
 * The second transport is the head unit's external Bluetooth module, reached through a vendor
 * daemon over a loopback socket, on units where `android.bluetooth` transmits nothing the phone
 * will ever see. See `connection/wifi/modes/nativeaa/zbt/ZbtByteChannel`.
