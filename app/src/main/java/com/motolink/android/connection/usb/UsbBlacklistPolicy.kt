 * The user's "never touch this device" list: how a device is named in it, and the membership test.

 * The key is the manufacturer and product strings rather than VID:PID, because a phone's VID:PID
 * changes with its USB mode while its strings do not. Keyed on the numbers, a blacklisted phone
 * walks straight back in on the next mode, and one that arrives already in accessory mode is never
 * matched at all. A device with no string descriptors falls back to VID:PID, which is all it had.
 *
 * The format is pinned because three places have to agree on it: the list UI writes it, the
 * device-protected mirror copies it, and a settings export hands it to the user as an editable file.
