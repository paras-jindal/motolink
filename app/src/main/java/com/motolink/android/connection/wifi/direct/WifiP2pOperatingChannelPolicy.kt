/**
 * Which operating channel to ask the P2P stack for, on the devices that have no band API.
 *
 * [com.motolink.android.connection.wifi.direct.NativeGroupBandPolicy] asks for a *band*, and that request only exists from API 29
 * (`WifiP2pConfig.Builder.setGroupOperatingBand`). Below it the app calls the no-argument
 * `createGroup` and the driver picks unaided, which is what every pre-Android-10 head unit in the
 * reports has been doing: `Standard createGroup SUCCESS!`, then `Freq: 0 MHz (unknown)`, with the
 * band unrecorded on our side and unchosen on theirs.
 *
 * There is one lever left on those devices. `WifiP2pManager.setWifiP2pChannels(c, listen, operating,
 * listener)` is hidden but present, and in AOSP 8.1's `SupplicantP2pIfaceHal` an operating channel is
 * turned into `setDisallowedFrequencies` around the single frequency it names - channel 36 becomes
 * 5180 MHz and everything either side of it is disallowed, so the group owner has nowhere else to go.
 * Reflection reaches it because the non-SDK blocklist only starts at API 28, and this app already
 * reflects into the same class for `setDeviceName`.
 *
 * Two constraints come from the platform and both are encoded here rather than left to the caller:
 *
 *  - The channel must be set **while no group exists**. `WifiP2pServiceImpl` handles `SET_CHANNEL`
 *    only in its inactive state, so a request made after `createGroup` is dropped silently.
 *  - The **listen** channel must be left alone. Discovery happens on the 2.4 GHz social channels
 *    (1, 6, 11) whatever the group runs on, and restricting it would make the unit undiscoverable.
 *    [LISTEN_CHANNEL_UNCHANGED] is the value that means "do not touch it".
 *
 * The request is tried as a ladder rather than once - see [attemptChannels] - because a frequency
 * list a unit cannot satisfy costs it the group rather than the band.
 *
 * Channel 36 rather than any other: it is the bottom of UNII-1, it is not a DFS channel, and it is
 * what the reference implementations use - `WirelessAndroidAutoDongle` brings its access point up on
 * channel 36, and the AAWireless dongle's own filing lists 5180-5240 and 5745-5825 while avoiding the
 * DFS range between them. [CHANNEL_UPPER] is offered for the same reason the filing lists two ranges:
 * a unit whose regulatory domain refuses UNII-1 may still take UNII-3.

     * A ladder rather than a single answer, because the request is a *disallowed-frequency list*

     * it names is not left on the other one, it is left with nowhere legal to put a group and fails
     * outright. Naming 2.4 GHz explicitly on the way down gives it somewhere to land, and the caller
     * clears the restriction entirely once this list is spent - so the worst case is the behaviour
     * that shipped before any of this existed, reached one bring-up later.
     *
     * That ladder is also what makes 5 GHz safe to try by default here. It used to be an opt-in

     *   pick does not work for them, and one refusal is not the window's answer. The 2.4 GHz rung
     *   below it stays either way, because a disallowed-frequency list a unit cannot satisfy costs
     *   it the group rather than the band.

     *   say. Only `false` drops a rung, and only under [P2pBandPreference.AUTO]: a `true` describes
     *   the station side and does not promise a group owner can be hosted there, so the ladder keeps
     *   its own fallback rather than trusting it. A user who asked for 5 GHz still gets the request
     *   made - the setting exists for a driver that surprises this call.
