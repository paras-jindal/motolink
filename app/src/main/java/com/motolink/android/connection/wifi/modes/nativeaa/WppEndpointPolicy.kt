 * The phone stores that endpoint alongside the network we hand it and from then on joins that
 * network instead of running the Bluetooth handshake again, with no fallback when it is gone. So an
 * endpoint is only safe on a network whose name and BSSID outlive the record. Our own access point
 * always qualifies. A WiFi Direct group qualifies once this unit has shown, across two bring-ups,
 * that its kept name comes back with the same address (GroupIdentityStabilityPolicy); until then,
 * and on a unit that re-addresses the group on every create, nothing is advertised.
 *
 * Withholding is not a cure, only a way of not causing it. An endpoint the phone was given earlier
 * survives for the life of its Android Auto process and is dialled in preference to Bluetooth, so
 * every refusal says how to clear one.
