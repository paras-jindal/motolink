/**
 * Which band the Native AA P2P group is requested on, and whether a group that came up on the other
 * one should be torn down and remade.
 *
 * Native AA asks for 5 GHz because that is the band the reporters' working sessions run on, and a
 * group that lands on 2.4 GHz anyway is recreated rather than used. That is what [P2pBandPreference
 * .AUTO] still does. What the other two positions exist for is the opposite case: two reporter
 * threads describe a link that dies for seconds at a time on a fixed cadence, on 2.4 GHz head units,
 * and nothing on the rig could ever be put on that band to look for it - `createQuietGroup` asks for
 * 5 GHz and `onGroupInfoAvailable` undoes any group that does not come up there, so the rig had two
 * independent reasons never to run the configuration the reports come from.
 *
 * Asking for 2.4 GHz turns off *both* of those, and it has to: leaving the mismatch retry armed
 * would tear the group down as soon as it succeeded. That coupling is the whole reason this is one
 * object with a test rather than two flags read in two places, and it now falls out of the request
 * itself - [shouldRetryFor5Ghz] only ever fires when 5 GHz was what was asked for.
 *
 * This started as a debug lever and is now a user preference, because the same question has a
 * user-facing answer on the hotspot route ([SoftApBandPolicy]) and having it on one transport and
 * not the other was the accident rather than the design. What each position costs is written down
 * in the hint string beside it and, for the measurement behind it, in [SoftApBandPolicy]'s KDoc.
