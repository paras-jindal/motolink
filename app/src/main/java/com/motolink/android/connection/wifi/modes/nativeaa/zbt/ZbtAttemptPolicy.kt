/**
 * When to try the Android Auto handshake over the external Bluetooth module.
 *
 * There is no "the phone connected" event on this route. Our own RFCOMM listener is what normally
 * says a phone has arrived, and here there is none: the daemon owns the Android Auto RFCOMM server
 * on the module, accepts the phone itself, and tells us nothing about it directly. The head unit is
 * also the side that speaks first in this handshake, so waiting for a byte from the phone would
 * wait forever.
 *
 * The vendor's own client solves this the same way, and that is where these rules come from. Its
 * log shows it gating on one thing — a link-state message naming a connected phone the module has
 * classified as Android Auto — and then sending `WifiVersionRequest` optimistically and retrying,
 * with no connection event of any kind in between. So: treat that message as the arrival signal,
 * attempt, and let the attempt's own timeouts recycle it.
 *
 * `PhoneLinkState` (`0x11f`) is deliberately **not** used, even though it looks like the ideal
 * signal. In the vendor's code the call that emits it is gated on a link-mode mask that
 * Android-Auto-only units do not carry, so on exactly the hardware this serves it is never sent.
