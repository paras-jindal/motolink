/**
 * Which 5 GHz channel the user pinned, for whichever transport is hosting the network.
 *
 * A phone's regulatory domain, not a head unit's radio, decides which 5 GHz channels it will join,
 * and a network on a channel that domain forbids is one the phone never lists at all. Several
 * domains refuse UNII-3, and Android's own group-owner selection picks a random one of the eight
 * candidates, so half the bring-ups on such a phone are invisible. This is the setting that stops
 * that being luck.
 *
 * One object rather than one per transport because the answer belongs to the user's phone and
 * country, not to WiFi Direct or the access point, and somebody who switches transport to work
 * around the problem must not silently lose the choice. What each transport can *do* with it
 * differs a great deal - see [WifiP2pOperatingChannelPolicy] and
 * [com.motolink.android.connection.wifi.modes.nativeaa.SoftApBandPolicy].
