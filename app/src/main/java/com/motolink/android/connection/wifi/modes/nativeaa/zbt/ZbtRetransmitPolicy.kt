 * Whether to repeat the handshake's opening message while the phone has said nothing.

 * message that arrived. On the module there is no accept: the daemon owns the Android Auto server,
 * and our first message can go out before the phone's channel exists on the far side, where it is
 * dropped with nobody told. Repeating is the only cover for that, and it is why the vendor's own
 * client repeats too.
 *
 * One answer from the phone retires it: from then on the exchange has its own stage deadlines.
