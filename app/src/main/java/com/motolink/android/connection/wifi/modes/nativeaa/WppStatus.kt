/**
 * Names the status codes the phone answers WPP messages with.
 *
 * Recovered from a serialized protobuf descriptor carrying Google's own
 * `androidauto.bluetooth.proto` naming, so these are the schema's names and not a reconstruction.
 * Only `== 0` is branched on; the point is that a log says WIFI_INCORRECT_CREDENTIALS, not -3.
 *
 * Deliberately a lookup rather than a proto enum. Every status field in `wireless.proto` is a plain
 * int32 because a sint32 declaration once rendered a real -8 as 2147483644, and a value the enum
 * does not know would land in unknown fields where the log could not see it at all.
