/**
 * The probe's two judgements, which are the whole point of the run: what arrived, and what that
 * means.
 *
 * The verdict is not decoration. It is the line the reporter reads off the screen and the line we
 * read out of an exported log, and its three interesting cases lead to three different next steps —
 * build the transport, work out how to be the module's only client, or work out how to make the
 * phone start Android Auto at all. A verdict that blurred two of those would send the next round in
 * the wrong direction, which is exactly what happened when round two had no way to tell them apart.
